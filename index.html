            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>By authorizing the Discord bot with the requested permissions, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms of Service. This document outlines the conditions under which you may grant access to our platform's Discord bot, which allows for data sharing and authentication between Discord and our services. Please read these terms carefully.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>2. Acceptance of Permissions</h2>
            <p>To proceed with the Discord bot integration, you must grant all the requested permissions during the authentication process. These permissions include, but are not limited to, access to your Discord username, friends list, server roles, permissions, user profile details, and other account information. You acknowledge that refusing these permissions may limit or prevent the functionality of the bot as intended.</p>
            <p>The bot will only use the permissions provided for the purposes explicitly outlined by our service. Any misuse, attempt to impersonate, or unauthorized use of the granted permissions may lead to immediate suspension or revocation of access and potential legal action. User safety is our priority, and any activity that compromises this will not be tolerated.</p>
            <p>To prevent misuse or unauthorized access, you agree to only use the Discord bot integration for its intended purposes. Any attempt to mislead, scam, or impersonate others by using this service will result in immediate termination of access and may lead to legal action. We take the protection of our users seriously, and any activity that compromises user safety will not be tolerated.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
            <p>All data accessed through the Discord bot will be used solely for the purpose of improving your experience with our services, such as streamlining server management, improving user engagement, and enabling custom bot features. By authorizing our bot, you permit us to use this information in compliance with our privacy policy and only for the purposes for which permissions were granted.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>4. Limitations of Liability</h2>
            <p>Our services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We shall not be liable for any damages resulting from the permissions granted or any issues arising due to unauthorized use or data exposure through the bot.</p>
            <p>While we implement strong security measures to protect against fraud or misuse, you are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials. Any actions taken using your Discord account after authorization are considered your responsibility, including interactions facilitated by the bot.</p>
            <p>We take fraud prevention seriously. We employ robust security measures to protect users from scams or unauthorized use of their data. However, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and any actions taken on your account using the Discord bot integration.</p>
